        <p>I glanced back at my pages and attempted to read as smoke lingered past once more in teasing wisps.  As I sneezed to relieve the burnt sensation in my nose, water pooled in the corner of my eyes, the world around me slightly blurred for a split second.  </p>
        <p>“Do you have a bar of soap?”</p>
        <p>Bewildered, I scanned the pages, having believed to have skipped a line or two.  A finger jabbed my side.  I practically fell off the bench when I finally acknowledged her.  Grammy.</p>
        <p>“Soap, kid, soap!”</p>
        <p>I burrowed my brow and stared.</p>
        <p>Elbow propped on the table, a cigarette sat comfortably between her fingers, as if it had never and would leave.  The end glowed and sent embers drifting to the ashtray she’d made out of the ground.  She tapped a finger on the rounded top to release a swirl of cinders.  I inhaled the fumes as they mixed with the lingering scent of fresh lemon and mint soap.  Her hair existed as mere patches of baby fuzz, bald spots dotted her scalp in the light, and a baby blue head scarf balanced on a crossed knee, the hand stitched initials of our names on the tie.  I remembered sewing them in while she waited for her first round of chemo to finish.  Her breath was a gentle rise and fall; an easy rhythm without the slightest hint of labor.  She squinted, her nose scrunched in thought.  Her head lifted slightly as she absolved her observations. </p>
        <p>“How’s Abbey Jean?”</p>
        <p>“Spoiled, as always,” I pulled in a ragged breath and tried to gain strength from thin air.  “She prefers pancakes to dog treats now.  Still sits on the car console when I go for a drive, just like you trained her.”</p>
        <p>She let out a deep, husky cackle, the one I always loved listening to.  The one I would search for with lame puns.  The one she let free when we mindlessly watched terrible reality shows after she couldn’t leave the house anymore and she was embarrassed of the tube hanging from her abdomen.  I always felt if she would cheer up for a moment, she could feel better, get better.  Laughter was the foundation of our relationship.
