        <p>Synopsis</p>
        <p>In this documentary, the history of Mono Lake will be explored so as to trace the valley’s lack of water back to its origin.  Once one of the largest lakes in the state, the Mono Basin is an isolated lake reliant on input from surrounding climate changes with no outlet.  In short, this means that the lake can only be drained only in the presence of man made extractions as it has no natural way for water to leave the lake.  Beginning in 1941 the lake begun drying up as a result of Los Angeles’s Aqueduct lowering the water elevation past its natural ability to refill itself. This had immediate as well as long lasting effects on the climate of the Mono Basin.  </p>
        <p>Treatment</p>
        <p>In this film, it would open with a time lapse shot of Mono Lake as the sun rises over the Tufas.  I want there to be a focus on the beauty of the lake as it is now, though I want to make it clear in the history of the lake that how we see it now is not how it should look.  The spectacles of the lake, such as the Tufa salt columns Pahoa Island, and Negit Island, better known as ‘the black island’ (Stine 309) are parts of the lake that should still be under water.  As a result of the water dropping a vertical 50+ feet as a result of water loss, these spectacles are now the most photographed parts of the lake.  In the first few shots there will be close ups of these columns as well as underwater shots of what the Tufas look under the water as well.  </p>
        <p>The next shot would then include a docent opening the doors to the local museum, coming from a medium slow motion shot into a close up of the hand unlocking the front door.  After this, there would be a shot of the historical pictures on the walls before a voice over of the docent comes in explaining her/his role at the museum as well as the information they know about Mono Lake and its history.  The camera would then turn to the docent who would continue explaining the beginnings of mono lake.  Ideally they would have a large book about the history of Mono Lake.  At this point the film would transition to an animation of the book flipping pages to the ‘start’ of Mono Lake with a title frame “Thirst Laws: A County Without Water” paired with a narration voice over stating “Mono Lake used to be a thriving water basin, but where did the water go? And where does that leave us no?” The ‘flipping’ of the book would be the technique relied upon to move the documentary forward.  </p>
        <p>This narrator would then take the audience through the basic history of the beginning of the lake being voice over images of what the lake used to look like.  The narration will be set up to fill in the gaps between the interview with the docent.  Essentially the narration will only have to fill in and further explain what the docent is saying with facts from legal cases and Los Angeles’s water laws during the start of the 1900s.  The ‘pages’ of the book used in the animation will be old found archival footage of the lake as well as old photographs from the peak of the lake’s popularity.  A couple of these photos will be shots of the lake from the past century that will later be contrasted with new photos of the lake.  The majority of the footage and photos early in the film that will be used will be archival images prior to and after the construction of Mulholland’s aqueduct, as well as showing images of the town, ranches, and factories disappearing. </p>
        <p>At this point in the film there will be an animation of historical factors coming into play that affect the Mono Basin. In an animation their will be these factors drawn on the screen, which will ‘expand’ as the factor places a large stress on Los Angeles becoming more reliant on Mono Lake. Narration such as “The initial mass influx of population into Los Angeles led them to look for alternate water sources, coming to the inevitable discovery of the Mono Basin water ways” will be said over this animation to explain them further.  </p>
        <p>The diversion of water would be explained via voiceover, paired with ‘plate’ images of a drawn areal view of the lake basin flipping across the lakes history.  The shots would quickly flick through geological drawings from 1919 to 1947 showing how the edge of the lake dramatically shrinks away from its original shore line after the first uses of the aqueduct in 1941, a shore line that had remained consistent for over hundreds of years.  Data was discovered once the lake receded and geologists could test cross sections of the Tufas which had previously remained under water, which provided proof that the lake had previously maintained the water elevation around 6, 392 feet.  Following this ‘time lapse’ there would be included a bar graph showing the difference in water elevation from 1919 to 1947(Stine 402).  There would also potentially be a 3-D animation of the lake as it receded to show how dramatic the drop in elevation was for this particular lake.  </p>
        <p>As the animation recedes to show the current level of the lake now in 2019 with the exposure of the Tufas, the film would ‘pause’ to explain how this lack of water has affected the lake and subsequently the surrounding areas. Along with this new exposure of salt figures in the lake was the creation of a new species – lake shrimp known as ‘brine shrimp’.  The shots would then move to close ups of the shrimp kept in the aquarium inside the museum while the docent points them out and explains how they really now on the salinity of the lake and would not be able to live without this new ecology.          </p>
        <p>The film would then turn to the tours given on the lake, during which tour guides allow groups to go out on guided canoe tours to get close to the Tufa and ‘fish’ for brine shrimp with cups.  The ability to find the brine shrimp will depend on when the filming of the documentary is done.  There would then be a narration explanation of how these tours commonly have to be canceled later in the day as winds rise and blow the salt off the surface of the water.  The wind, strengthening towards the center of the lake, has the ability of suffocate anyone still on the lake when the winds pick up.  This consequence subsequently has destroyed the boating popularity of the lake, a leisure which once attracted hundreds of visitors and tourists that helped the economy of the county. In a voice over the narrator would remind the audience of the earlier photos shown, stating that the lake which once allowed a boisterous amount of boats, now can only host guided canoe and kayak tours so as to assure the safety of those wanting to go out on the lake.   </p>
        <p>Using this explanation of the change in ecology, the film would then move into the explanation of the how surrounding areas, namely the farms, which used to be wholly reliant on the lakes water all inevitably were unable to stay in business.  Since the shortage of the water and increase in salinity, however, almost all of these farms now no longer exist resulting in the town and county becoming reliant on capital income from tourists.  The film will then point to Los Angeles becoming reliant on other water sources, however, during the decades that they were reliant on Mono Valley’s water, the economy and environment were forever changed.
