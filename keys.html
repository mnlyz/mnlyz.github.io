        <p>“It’s perfect.”  For once I wasn’t lying.  The place was exactly what I had needed without ever realizing it.  Tucked behind the bed and breakfast, the house snuggled between tightly knitted trees.  The outside was made of the same wood from the forest, the entirety of the thing only a few rooms large.  A little porch sat comfortably between two pines, the stairs just barely beginning to grow moss from the fading humidity of the summer.  Nan led me inside, and I knew this was home before I even closed the door behind us.  A brightly painted kitchen led to the living room, a round table bridging between the two.  A low sagging couch covered in thickly fluffed cushions faced a brick fireplace, the only source of warmth for when the temperature began to drop.  Beyond the cushion I could see down a hallway containing five doors.  I felt in a trance as I peered into each doorway.  Two bedrooms, a pantry, washroom/ mudroom, and bathroom.  I could actually feel a tiny amount of bliss returning to my life.  </p>
        <p>“So?” Nan waited in the kitchen for me to return.
            I just smiled at her, afraid to break the wonderful spell of the day.
        </p>
        <p>“How much is it going for?”</p>
        <p>“Well, the owner doesn’t even rent it out anymore, but I know her personally and can argue your case.”</p>
        <p>“Could I speak to them? I’ll work for them cleaning or babysitting.  Really, I’m not opposed to much.”</p>
        <p>“Well seeing as I don’t need any help with cleaning, I wouldn’t mind someone to watch the children here and there.”</p>
        <p>Befuddled I just stared, slowly realizing that this was Nan’s place.</p>
        <p>“George and I built it when we first moved here.  A lot of good memories in this place.”  Her eyes glazed over as she ran a hand along the counter top.  “I’d be more than happy just to know someone is enjoying the place again.”  Coming across the room, she plopped the keys into my hand.  </p>
        <p>“Nan. I can’t just-"</p>
        <p>“Yes. You can. And you will.”</p>
        <p>I opened my mouth like a guppy out of water. </p>
        <p>“I’ll check in on Sundays, and you can come to the B and B after 3 on the weekdays to watch the three wild ones for an hour or two.  Sound good?”</p>
        <p>I just bobbed my head up and down, still standing mute as she left, the door softly thudding behind her.  I think I may have found my very own angel.  Turning around a couple of times, I decided to let my thoughts catch up to me on the couch.  It felt lower than it looked, but I had no idea how every couch wasn’t designed like this one.  My eyes were adjusting to the dim light when I saw the photos on the mantel piece.  Pushing myself back up, I picked up each frame and observed its contents.  </p>
        <p>It was Nan’s life, snapshots from every important memory she’d experienced.  The first was a foldable frame with two baby photos, the sepia crackled with sun spots of time.  In the second a couple smiled at one another, their faces highlighted in black and white.  Another showed another small child, this time in color, the couple from the previous photos swinging her by her arms, blond curly queues flying in the wind.  I flipped over the last one and almost dropped the loose glass.  An invitation fluttered to the ground and I leaned in half to retrieve it off the ground.  The cream had a smudge of the back corner, but the front remained unmarked, a young woman smiling up at me.  Her eyes were a pale blue, offset with ivory skin and wild curls.  Beneath the face, script announce,<em> “Please join us for a celebration of life.”</em> Under that <em>January 1987 – August 2014</em>.  I gently put the invitation back behind the glass and sat up the frame.  The photo showing was not the invitation, however, but three babies, all swaddled and pressed together, the middle one frozen in the picture mid cry.  
        </p>
        <p>I swiped at my cheek, my skin fresh with tears.  It shouldn’t have bothered me as much as it did, but my heart felt as if someone had crushed it in their fist.  I backed away from the pictures and curled into a ball next the couch.  I rocked back and forth failing miserably to focus on anything else.  
        </p>
        <p>I could feel the little hand, wrapped around my index finger, the strength lacking, and suddenly I was back in the hospital.  The smell of antiseptic had bothered me, I remember begging Jax to take us home, I didn’t want the babies first memory to be the smell of a hospital.  Why couldn’t we just go home?  The babies face stayed fixed on the ceiling, his lips purple, they had never gotten the chance to turn pink.   The nurse had come in and I tore the IV’s from the back of my hands, my blood mixing with his.  His sweet little face didn’t even twitch when I jumped out of the bed and tried to make it down the hallway.  He didn’t cry.  I thought that was odd at first. <em> Why wasn’t he crying? Maybe he’s just a happy baby?  </em>But Jax had stopped me in the doorway and I had clung his little body even closer.  <em>I want to go home.</em>  So Jax kissed my tears and said okay, gently taking the baby from my arms.  The nurse took the baby from Jax and that’s when I saw the body bag in the hallway.  I started screaming and lunged at the nurse.  Jax had grasped in anticipation, though, and wrapped his arms all the way around me, my face pressed firmly to his chest. <em> I’m so so sorry. I’m sorry.</em> He just kept repeating himself as both of our tears soaked through his shirt.  Something pricked the back of my arm and the world went dark.
