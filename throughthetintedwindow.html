    <p >FADED TIMELAPSE:</p>
        <p>The coffee turns into water then into wine. Layla looks at her computer constantly. The room darkens and lights turn on.</p>
        <p >INT. LAYLA’S DINNING ROOM. NIGHT.</p>
        <p >Layla scrolls past Alice’s facebook.  Alice’s hand and another’s hold glasses of wine. CAPTION reads “Fun time with the family!” More photos show Alice with ED and other family members. Comments on the side read “Love you!” “Let’s do it again sometime!”. Alice’s reply at the bottom reads “Love you too! There is nothing more important than family!”
        Layla scoffs and sips at her merlot.  The computer freezes on the image. She furiously taps on the mousepad. She slams her computer closed, walks away, and grabs the wine bottle to fill her empty glass. On the coffee table the photo book sits open on Alice. Layla moves to the couch and sits.   </p> 
        <p >MATCH CUT TO:</p>
        <p >INT. ALICE’S DINING ROOM. NIGHT.</p>
        <p >Alice sits at a table. The room is well lit. All the furniture has ninety degree angles and is either white or black. Alice sips her wine, alone.  A single photo book lays open. She flips through the photos of baby Layla.  </p>
        <p >INT. LAYLA’S DINNING ROOM. NIGHT</p>
        <p >WIDE SHOT -- Layla walks into the kitchen. A drawer SLAMS. She grabs the book and walks to the porch. A wine bottle is in her hand.  </p>
        <p >EXT. LALYA’S APARTMENT PORCH. NIGHT.</p>
        <p >Layla filters through photos and pulls from the pages.  She stares at them, chugs some wine, and wipes her nose.  At the last photo, the one of Alice smiling, Layla stands.  She gently pulls if from the page and drops the book to the ground.  </p>
        <p >INT. ALICE’S DINING ROOM. NIGHT.</p>
        <p >Alice stops on the last page of the book, carefully tracing the edge of a Graduation Invite. It is the only adult photo she has of her daughter. She pulls the last photo out of the back cover and holds it close to her face.  The photo is of her holding Layla the day she was born. She takes a long drink of her wine and a single tear falls. </p>
        <p >EXT. LAYLA'S DINNING ROOM. NIGHT.</p>
        <p >A small flame glows in front of Layla. The flame falls into the trash can and quickly grows. One by one, she drops photos into the fire.  She looks up to the sky a breathes deeply before looking back at the trashcan. 
        Layla closes her eyes tightly before opening them. Tears roll down her emotionless face.  She does not sob.  She pulls a photo from her back pocket and looks at it once more. She looks between it and the fire.  The light flickers and shows Alice smiling and holding a baby in a hospital.  Rain starts to pour.  The light flickers and dies. </p>
        <p >CUT TO BLACK.</p>
