        <p>When they came and took Cory in second grade, Doubt took his place.  Doubt was an odd kind of friend, rather quiet. Cory seemed to be the only one listening to her, or at least the only one who knew she was there.  Doubt never wore colors, unless they were deepened in a hue almost black.  Doubt never cared what kind of shoes she put on in the morning or if her hair looked clean.  She knotted her laces more than twice <em>because you can’t trust a single thing.</em> The first month without Chris, Doubt thought it was best to lock herself in bathrooms wailing for hours on end.  At night, she’d curl onto the end of the bed, poking Cory’s shins if she ever slightly drifted off.<em>Do you think he wanted to go without you? Do you think they asked if they’d take just him and not you? Do you think his new home has a puppy that he gets all to himself?</em> </p>
        <p>In third grade, Cory pretended Chris was somewhere on the other side of the state trying to catch buses back to where he’d been.  That was the year she discovered there was no one left on this earth that would ask how she was, except Doubt.  Teachers would forget she was still behind her desk, would happily open their pre-arranged Tupperware, microwaved in thirty second intervals and sigh with the rising steam while kicking off ridged heels.  Doubt would whisper <em>Watch her twist her ankles in those ridiculous things. Maybe she has extra change in that outer pocket.  A bus ticket is only fifty-three dollars to get to Chris.</em>
        </p>
        <p>“God these kids are a handful this year.”</p>
        <p> “Judy said they were the worst second grade year.”</p>
        <p>Classes got larger when the leaves began dying off, when Cory felt like forcing herself into smaller spaces.  These were her favorite places – the invisible ones, the forgotten ones, and the unknown ones.  The hollow space just before the slides shot out children.  Dusty corners behind large bookshelves and crevices deep in piles of backpacks. She’d slip away during nap time in the dark, when the teacher set her over-powdered botoxed face into the sad cracked wood she called her desk.  Doubt would wait at the desk, snoozing for a second while Cory escaped.  Straining her eyes, she’d lay her cheek close into the wall, trying to avoid the webs that had been established since the 90s.  That’s how she found her first love: Judy Blume.  Doubt hated her for being pretentious enough to think herself worthy of writing books for Cory.         </p>
        <p>By fourth grade she found herself dreading the P.E. bell. Children would shove and trample and shriek, vultures taking flight into the sun and tar.  Once a week, she would eat it over the edge of the railing, the pudgy kid from sixth grade loving how easy it was to lift her.  The searing edges would burn her hands as she clung for dear life, everything flipping through the air.  Each time she’d land on her back, taking a little longer to get up, staring at the clouds and wondering if Chris still looked for puppies and clowns and dreams in the sky.        </p>
        <p>The first time someone pretended to be concerned, they asked Cory if Jonathon should be told on.  No.  There was no use in helping him receive the attention.  It was a pointless matter, wanting something unattainable.          </p>
        <p>“You’re weirder than me, and that’s not a good weird.” <em> Hypocrite.  </em>    </p>
        <p>Cory would shrug.  The same thing would happen tomorrow.  <em>Yeah. And the day after.</em>  The yard duty specifically ignored her, not having time to worry if every child could contain themselves as to not cry for the length of one single day.  So they began the long standing tradition of Cory being ignored.  Fourth grade became a memory of being erased.  Sixth grade was no better.  Though it was the year Doubt found out black jeans gave a certain curve to the way Cory walked and would catcall each morning those ripped pieces of fabric found their way on her porcelain hips. </p>
        <p>“You’re a leftover kid!” Flipping a page, little Cory remained un-phased by yet again being the subject of entertainment.  The wasted energy of eleven year olds.  
        </p>
        <p>“Did you hear me runt?!” She turned another page, the princess riding off on bare horseback, wind in her hair, sun rays licking her golden braids. <em>God this book is dumb.  You’re not a princess, who would save you.  Yourself, that’s the only person you can count on. </em>  </p>
        <p>“You get the leftovers of everything!” A couple kids giggled and joined in.  Their voices chirping into the sound of the wind and birds floating past her imagination. <em>You even rented this book, they’re not entirely wrong.  </em>She only felt the warmth of the rising sun reach her toes as it crept across the school yard. </p>
        <p>“You get the leftover clothes!” “You get the leftover food!” “You get the leftover friends!” The chapter ended, finishing the book, finishing the dream.  Neatly closing the spine, Cory looked over her bent knee caps at the pudgy ring leader.  </p>
        <p>“It seems to me that you eat enough of the leftovers by yourself Jonathon.”</p>
        <p>The taste of iron filled her mouth and flooded her nose before the color red stained her thoughts and drove her foot square into his stomach.  She didn’t even notice the recess monitor walking towards her as she changed her book from a story of adventure into one of destruction, solidly whacking the two other minions that came charging at her as the pudgy one became a plush circle on the ground, his blonde hair flopping onto the pavement.</p>
