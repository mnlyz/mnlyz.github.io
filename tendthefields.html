            <p>When Mama took Annabelle, all the noise in the house left, music from their radio singing them down the street.  Wind whistled through the house, bringing shivers as the sun disappeared.  Everything was quiet, deathly still. Even the leaves seemed to move without the actual sound of the wind sashaying between them.  The candles burned down on the cake Georgia had made herself, eighteen candles pooling wax into the icing, the smell of burning sugar lost through the open windows.  Georgia had first sat on the steps, eyes glued to that tree in the front yard, the smallest of the two.  The roots had begun to crack across the ground so she traced over them with her eyes.  Lit by the sun they seemed so much sharper as each section destroyed the earth before plunging back into the earth’s heart, wrapping root after root around it.  How did the heart survive, so strangled? She lay sideways considering this thought, feeling herself turn to stone.  She lay there for three days until the neighbor’s son came by as a dutiful next-door-farmer: a piece of fencing had been blown over in the wind.  He crouched before the bottom step and looked up to her eyes, feeling the pain of her strangled heart as his own.  </p>
            <p>The longer she was alone in the house, the more she seemed to clean, unable to bring herself to the orchard the first week of the season, letting the first pick of fresh apples plunge to the ground.  She swept the floor boards and scrubbed the grout in the counter tiles.  Emptied the trash from every room.  Beat the rugs until the sweat trickled down her spine, and then beat it some more.  No matter how hard she tried, she always found more dust.  It was settled in the cracks of the porch, swirled in eddies every time she climbed the stairs, plumed from beneath the cushions each time she fluffed the couch pillows.  It was gritty and coarse and clung to her skin.  </p>
            <p>Around June, the first heat wave, or at least one of the worst ones to hit in a while, wrapped around Georgia’s mind like a fog.  The more she scrubbed the floor the more spots of dust appeared until she sat back and realized the floor being scrubbed wouldn’t solve anything.  No one ever went in the basement except for emergencies, but there wasn’t anyone to go down their anymore anyway.  Grabbing the sledge hammer from its place next to the door, she dragged it back to the kitchen, staring at the black and white checkered island.</p>
            <p>Georgia used to watch her mama for hours, the dough being spread razor thin, exact cuts plating slices of sunset apples.  </p>
            <p>“Mama why can’t we make peach cobbler?” </p>
            <p>“Because peaches only <em>look</em> pretty.  They don’t last that long and not a single one tastes how you’d remember it.”            </p>
            <p>“Oh.” </p>
            <p>“Besides, your sister would swell and that’d ruin her chance of becoming Miss Darling.”
            </p>
            <p>“Mama why can’t I be a darling? I’m almost a whole year older.”
            </p>
            <p>“Because - “the rolling pin tapped the counter so Ida could smooth her apron and pin back the single hair back into silken curls.  “You, <em>my</em> darling, have far more to accomplish in this life.  Your sister is only nine and she needs different things than you.”</p>
            <p>Georgia would thumb the edges of scrap dough, tiny imprints pushing the edges until the middle became thin as air.  </p>
            <p>The sledge hammer was louder than she thought it would be, but the island crumbled with a satisfying bang.   Black and white shards flew everywhere.  The cabinets joined them on the floor as they splintered.  Georgia climbed on top of the chair and flung the whole hammer at the next cabinet, pieces of mahogany and plates exploding everywhere.  That damned song filled her mind, “Mama Told Me Not to Come”, the same tune that filled that Cadillac as they drove away.  Picking up the chair she was on, Georgia launched it out the back porch screen door, the legs snapping off and taking the mesh screen with it.  It all only took twenty minutes. The only thing still standing was the kitchen sink.  Georgia leaned on the edge of the crackling enamel, the bottom of the wash basin creaking.  A drop of blood fell and Georgia saw in the window’s reflection the gash across her cheek.  Her hair was strewn across her forehead, little strands sticking to the sweat.  </p>
