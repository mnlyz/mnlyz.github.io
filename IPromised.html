        <p>I remember when Kacey was born.  When she finally came home, I would hug her tight and sneak her into my room during early mornings when my parents were still asleep, most times tripping the alarm inputted in her blanket to monitor her breathing.  The times I succeeded, I would whisper promises, read her stories, and braid her hair as it grew longer through the years. By high school she had cut it all - in time for my graduation photos.  I forced her to take them with me, I wanted proof that we had both gone to the same torture of a high school.  Proof that we had survived the year.  We only took pictures from the waist up, I was still disfigured and in casts.     </p>
        <p>When we were kids, Kacey and I would pretend to be doctors, taking turns being the patient in distress.  We would make up names to diseases, and as we got older, injuries we thought only happened on TV.  We’d cover ourselves in ketchup, our mother yelling as the clothes gathered spots.  I would scream “I’ll save you!” as I signaled for nurses to assist in surgery.  Our favorite one, Kacey would be the doctor, and I would rush in jabbering about a car that had come from no where.  Run over innocent people, clipped me but left my crippled body to tell the tale.  It was a fun narrative until we were forced to live in its reality.  We designed our own narrative of destruction.  I was seventeen.  She was fourteen.   For the first time in our lives, I took the light from her.  Our parents began focusing on my well being.  
        </p>
        <p>By the time she was in college, I had been on my own, I had forgotten what it was like to live at home with my sister.  I couldn’t let go of this feeling, despite her now having the limelight returned, like I had abandoned her.  We needed to grow up.  It was around a year after college that the nightmares started.  It’s always the same one.  It starts with me trying to find Kacey, searching through our neighborhood, from a time before people brought life to the buildings.  I always return to our house, finding a hollow skeleton.  The walls aren’t walls yet.  Our home isn’t a home yet, but it’s the start of something beautiful.  If I stand still enough I can hear the breeze moving through the house, filling the space between the walls with energy.  There is no stucco, no paint, just the start of something being born from nothing.  I walk through the empty rooms, filling them with memories.  Color appears, doors seal in each space, pictures hang themselves.  The further I walk, the closer I get to the home I knew as a child, the only return being in my dreams. The sun hides itself behind a cloud bank and rain coats the large windows, tinting the house blue.  My legs weaken and I fall, my confusion abiding my bodies lack of will to move.  The breeze turns into gusts, shattering the windows and filling the house with water.  It rises as I lay there, watching, pleading.  Furniture begins to float, the pool out back overflowing, water rushing up the stairs, lapping at my legs, dragging me down down down.
